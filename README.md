This repository has four projects, two of them are about social media trends and sentiments and using models to predict the sentiment.
Another project deals with ratings of courses offered by an institute and developing a suitable model to predict the ratings of courses 
offered. Lastly, we have a project on image classification with the objective to classify a certain image of an animal as cat or dog. In each project we explore 
the dataset provided, and develop and test various prediction models to find out the best suited among them.
